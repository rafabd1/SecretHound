### Core Components

1. **CLI Layer**: Handles command-line parsing, argument validation, and workflow orchestration
2. **Core Layer**: Implements the core scanning and processing logic
3. **Networking Layer**: Manages HTTP requests, rate limiting, and domain management
4. **Output Layer**: Handles logging, progress reporting, and result output
5. **Utility Layer**: Provides common utilities and helper functions
6. **Config Layer**: Manages application configuration

## Command-Line Interface

The CLI is built using the Cobra library, which provides a structured approach to command-line applications.

### Commands

1. **version**: Displays version information for the application.
2. **completion**: Generates shell completion scripts.
3. **help**: Provides help information for other commands.

### Command Explanations

- **completion**: Generates auto-completion scripts for various shells (bash, zsh, fish, powershell). This allows tab-completion of SecretHound commands in your terminal.

- **help**: Provides detailed help information about available commands and flags.

- **version**: Shows the current version of SecretHound.

## Core Processing Flow

1. **Input Collection**: The application collects input sources from command-line arguments and input files.
2. **Input Categorization**: Inputs are categorized as remote URLs or local files.
3. **Processing**:
   - For remote URLs: Requests are scheduled with domain awareness to avoid overwhelming servers.
   - For local files: Files are processed concurrently with a worker pool.
4. **Secret Detection**: Content is analyzed using regex patterns to detect secrets.
5. **Output**: Discovered secrets are logged and written to the output file.

### Secret Detection

Secret detection is performed using regular expressions with additional context analysis to reduce false positives. The process includes:

1. **Pattern Matching**: Apply regex patterns to identify potential secrets
2. **Context Analysis**: Analyze surrounding text to validate potential secrets
3. **Filtering**: Filter out common false positives based on heuristics
4. **Validation**: Perform type-specific validation for certain secret types

## Threading Model

SecretHound uses a concurrent processing model with controlled parallelism:

- **Worker Pools**: Tasks are distributed among a pool of worker goroutines
- **Semaphores**: Limit concurrency when needed to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Context-Based Cancellation**: Enable graceful shutdown and timeout handling
- **Thread-Safe Components**: All shared resources are protected with mutexes

## Networking Architecture

### Domain-Aware Request Management

SecretHound implements domain-aware request scheduling to avoid overloading individual domains:

1. **Domain Grouping**: URLs are grouped by domain before scheduling
2. **Round-Robin Distribution**: Requests are distributed across domains in a round-robin fashion
3. **Rate Limiting**: Per-domain rate limiting prevents overwhelming servers
4. **Cooldown Periods**: Automatic cooldown periods between requests to the same domain
5. **Exponential Backoff**: Automatic backoff when rate limiting is detected

### HTTP Client Features

1. **Request Retries**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
2. **Jitter**: Random jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
3. **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts with context-based cancellation
4. **Response Filtering**: Intelligent response filtering to detect rate limiting and WAF blocks
5. **User-Agent Rotation**: Randomized user agents to avoid fingerprinting

## Output System

### Terminal Output Management

SecretHound uses a specialized terminal output system to provide a responsive and informative user experience:

1. **Progress Bar**: Real-time progress bar showing completion percentage and statistics
2. **Colored Logging**: Color-coded log messages for different severity levels
3. **Terminal Controller**: Coordinates between progress bar and log messages to prevent overlap
4. **Rate Statistics**: Shows processing rate and ETA

### Result Output

Results can be output in multiple formats:

1. **Text Format**: Human-readable format with contextual information
2. **JSON Format**: Structured format for programmatic processing

## Extension Points

SecretHound can be extended in several ways:

1. **Custom Regex Patterns**: Add your own regex patterns via configuration file
2. **User-Agent Customization**: Modify the HTTP client's user agent
3. **Output Format Customization**: Modify the output format for integration with other tools

## Design Decisions

### Concurrency Control

We chose a hybrid approach to concurrency control that combines:

1. **Fixed Worker Pool**: A fixed number of worker goroutines for predictable resource usage
2. **Dynamic Queue Management**: Dynamic adjustment of task prioritization based on domain
3. **Semaphore-Based Limiting**: Simple semaphore primitive for additional concurrency control

### Error Handling

Error handling follows these principles:

1. **Categorized Errors**: Errors are categorized by type (network, parsing, etc.)
2. **Graceful Degradation**: The application continues processing when possible, even if some operations fail
3. **Detailed Logging**: Errors are logged with context for troubleshooting
4. **Non-Fatal Approach**: Most errors are non-fatal, allowing processing to continue

### Rate Limiting Strategy

The rate limiting strategy combines:

1. **Token Bucket Algorithm**: Classic token bucket for basic rate limiting
2. **Adaptive Timing**: Timing parameters adapt based on observed server responses
3. **Domain Separation**: Rate limits are enforced per domain
4. **Probabilistic Rate Adjustment**: Rate limits are adjusted probabilistically to avoid oscillation

## Performance Considerations

SecretHound is designed for high performance with reasonable resource usage:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming processing where possible to minimize memory usage
2. **CPU Efficiency**: Parallel processing with configurable concurrency
3. **Network Efficiency**: Domain-aware scheduling to maximize throughput
4. **Resource Control**: Configurable limits to prevent resource exhaustion

## Security Considerations

When using SecretHound, consider the following security aspects:

1. **Network Visibility**: Your requests will be visible to network operators
2. **Local File Access**: The application requires access to local files you want to scan
3. **Output Security**: Results contain sensitive information and should be secured
